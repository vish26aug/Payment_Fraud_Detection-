# Payment_Fraud_Detection-
My approach to the task of payment fraud detection! This is a real-world problem, with fraud accounting for billions of dollars worth of loss, worldwide. 


Notebook Outline

We'll go over the following steps to complete the notebook.

    Load in and explore payment transaction data
    Train a LinearLearner to classify the data
    Improve a basic model by accounting for class imbalance in the dataset and different metrics for model "success"

Later: Delete Resources

At the end of this exercise, and intermittently, you will be reminded to delete your endpoints and resources so that you do not incur any extra processing or storage fees!
